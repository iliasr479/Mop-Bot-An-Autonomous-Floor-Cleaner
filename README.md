# Mop-Bot-An-Autonomous-Floor-Cleaner
The Mop Bot is an autonomous floor-cleaning robot developed by Group 05 as part of the EEE 318_B1 course at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). This project integrates robot dynamics, sensor data processing, and feedback control to create a robot capable of navigating spaces and cleaning floors efficiently.
Key Features:
Autonomous Navigation: The bot uses sonar sensors for obstacle detection and moves based on real-time feedback.

Mopping System: Equipped with a rotating mop and a water spray pump, the Mop Bot ensures thorough cleaning by spraying water intermittently.

Manual Control: Bluetooth functionality allows for manual control of movement, providing flexibility for specific cleaning needs.

Technologies Used:
Arduino for controlling the botâ€™s movement and cleaning mechanism.

Sonar sensors for obstacle detection.

Bluetooth module for manual control of the robot.

Motor dynamics for driving movement and mopping actions.

Current Progress:
Functional manual control of movement using Bluetooth.

Basic obstacle detection and avoidance using sonar sensors.

Mopping functionality activated by intermittent water spraying.

Future Work:
Improved sonar sensor accuracy for better obstacle detection and navigation.

Full automatic control for seamless movement and cleaning.

Integration of gyro sensors to enhance robot stability and balance.

This repository contains all the source code, hardware setup, and progress reports related to the project. Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or enhance functionality as we continue to work on making Mop Bot a fully autonomous cleaning solution.
